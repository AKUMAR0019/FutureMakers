Day 1:
---------
One new thing I learned today was how to set up Jupyter Notebooks. I normally use PyCharm to code, and it was very interesting to see how Jupyter runs each line of code when you type it as opposed to going from start to finish as you run it. 

I hope to learn more about how to code AI using modules like TensorFlow, because while I do know how to use scikit-learn and other machine learning tools, I do not know enough about AI. My hope is that I can then use my knowledge to aid in the field of neuroscience. I really can't wait to get started :)!

Day 2:
---------
Today, I learned how to tell a story about myself that comes from the heart, a story that shows my motivations and my challenges, and how I moved past hurdles. I learned that the world may have problems, but the way to take action on those problems is to combine both heart and head to create unique solutions. I learned that I am a leader, because a leader motivates others so that a community can together solve a problem. Today was amazing, and I'm so glad I got the opportunity to attend this session.

Day 3:
---------
Today, I learned how validation is different from testing, which was very helpful, as I didn't understand the distinction until today.

i. In supervised learning, training data already has labels, and the idea is to learn from feedback and predict the outcome. In unsupervised learning, the training data has no labels, so there's no feedback and one learns from the patterns.

ii. It is false because scikit-learn is built on other modules like NumPy, SciPy, IPython, Sympy, pandas, and matplotlib. It does data mining and data analysis, but to collect that data or display that data, it requires other libraries. 


Day 4:
---------
Today, I learned what the TPU is. I had no idea that there was such a thing as a Tensor Processing Unit which can speed up AI processing. 

The dataset I found is a dataset on breast cancer metastases in whole-slide images of histological lymph node sections. The link is here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BzsdkU4jWx9Bb19WNndQTlUwb2M?resourcekey=0-FREBAxB4QK4bt9Zch_g5Mg. To use deep learning on this algorithm, I would use pattern recognition, especially to identify which slides have evidence of cancer.
