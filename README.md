Day 1:
---------
One new thing I learned today was how to set up Jupyter Notebooks. I normally use PyCharm to code, and it was very interesting to see how Jupyter runs each line of code when you type it as opposed to going from start to finish as you run it. 

I hope to learn more about how to code AI using modules like TensorFlow, because while I do know how to use scikit-learn and other machine learning tools, I do not know enough about AI. My hope is that I can then use my knowledge to aid in the field of neuroscience. I really can't wait to get started :)!

Day 2:
---------
Today, I learned how to tell a story about myself that comes from the heart, a story that shows my motivations and my challenges, and how I moved past hurdles. I learned that the world may have problems, but the way to take action on those problems is to combine both heart and head to create unique solutions. I learned that I am a leader, because a leader motivates others so that a community can together solve a problem. Today was amazing, and I'm so glad I got the opportunity to attend this session.
