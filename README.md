Day 1:

One new thing I learned today was how to set up Jupyter Notebooks. I normally use PyCharm to code, and it was very interesting to see how Jupyter runs each line of code when you type it as opposed to going from start to finish as you run it. 

I hope to learn more about how to code AI using modules like TensorFlow, because while I do know how to use scikit-learn and other machine learning tools, I do not know enough about AI. My hope is that I can then use my knowledge to aid in the field of neuroscience. I really can't wait to get started :)!
